# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This is my first machine learning project built using Python and scikit-learn.
The goal of this project is to predict a student's final score based on factors
such as study hours, attendance, sleep hours, and previous academic performance.

This project focuses on understanding the complete end-to-end workflow of a
regression-based machine learning model rather than achieving very high accuracy.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Can we predict a student's final performance using basic academic and lifestyle
features?
