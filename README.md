This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I am building as part of my learning journey.

Each project focuses on practical implementation of machine learning concepts using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

## What this repository includes
- End-to-end machine learning projects
- Real-world datasets
- Clean and well-structured code
- Proper documentation for each project
