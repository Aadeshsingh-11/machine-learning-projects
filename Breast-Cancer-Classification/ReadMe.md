# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project applies classification algorithms to predict whether a tumor is
benign or malignant using a medical dataset.

## Objective
Practice the end-to-end machine learning workflow for classification.

## Dataset
- Source: Breast Cancer dataset
- Target column: Class (2 = Benign, 4 = Malignant)

## Approach
- Data cleaning
- Train–test split
- Feature scaling
- Classification model training
- Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
